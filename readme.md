## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews! -->

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to make a new instance for the object and reuse it's properties and methods with new characters! I used Marvel characters because they're always streetfighting, and it's very useful that I can make infinite amount of characters due to OOP classes reusability.
